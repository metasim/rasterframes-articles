Human beings have a
millennia-long history of organizing information in tabular form. Typically, rows
represent independent events or observations, and columns represent measurements
from the observations. The forms have evolved, from hand-written agricultural
records and transaction ledgers, to the advent of spreadsheets on the personal
computer, and on to the creation of [R Data Frames][R] and [Python
Pandas][Pandas]. The table-oriented data structure remains a common and
critical component of organizing data across industries, and is the mental model
employed by many data scientists across diverse forms of modeling and analysis. 

Today, DataFrames are the _lingua franca_ of data science. The evolution of the
tabular form has continued with Apache Spark SQL, which brings DataFrames to the
big data distributed compute space. Through several novel innovations, Spark SQL
enables interactive and batch-oriented cluster computing without having to be
versed in the highly specialized skills typically required for high-performance
computing. As suggested by the name, these DataFrames are manipulatable via
standard SQL, as well as the more general-purpose programming languages Python,
R, Java, and Scala.

RasterFramesÂ®, an incubating Eclipse Foundation LocationTech project, brings
together Earth-observing (EO) data analysis, big data computing, and
DataFrame-based data science. The recent explosion of EO data from public and
private satellite operators presents both a huge opportunity as well as a
challenge to the data analysis community. It is _Big Data_ in the truest sense.

RasterFrames provides a DataFrame-centric view over arbitrary EO data, enabling
spatiotemporal queries, map algebra raster operations, and
compatibility with the ecosystem of Spark ML algorithms.

## Architecture

RasterFrames is not only built on Spark SQL, but also most of the other
LocationTech projects: [GeoTrellis](https://geotrellis.io/),
[GeoMesa](https://www.geomesa.org/), [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts),
and [SFCurve](https://github.com/locationtech/sfcurve).

RasterFrames introduces a new native data type called `tile` to Spark SQL. A
"RasterFrame" is any DataFrame with one or more columns of type `tile`. A `tile`
column typically represents a single frequency band of sensor data, such as
"blue" or "near infrared", discretized into regular-sized chunks. Along with
`tile` columns there is typically a `geometry` column specifying the location of
the data, the map projection of that geometry (`crs`), and a `timestamp` column
representing the acquisition time.

Raster data can be read from a number of sources. Through the flexible Spark SQL
DataSource API, RasterFrames can be constructed from collections of (preferably
Cloud Optimized) GeoTIFFs, GeoTrellis Layers, and from an experimental catalog
of Landsat 8 and MODIS data sets on the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Data
Set (PDS)][PDS]. Astraea, Inc. is also experimenting with support for the
evolving [Spatiotemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)][STAC].

## Example

The following example will show some of the general operations available in
RasterFrames. It utilizes the [_MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Surface Reflectance
Data Product_][NBAR] from NASA, which is directly available through AWS PDS. The
example extracts data using the RasterFrames MODIS catalog data source and
manipulates it via SQL (as noted above, Python, Java, and Scala are also
options). We will compute the monthly global average of a [vegetation
index][NDVI] in 2017 and see how it varies over the year.

> **Note**: RasterFrames version 0.8.0-RC1 was used in this example.

The first step is to load the MODIS catalog data source into a table and see
what it provides:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW modis USING `aws-pds-modis`;
DESCRIBE modis;
-- +----------------+------------------+
-- |col_name        |data_type         |
-- +----------------+------------------+
-- |product_id      |string            |
-- |acquisition_date|timestamp         |
-- |granule_id      |string            |
-- |gid             |string            |
-- |assets          |map<string,string>|
-- +----------------+------------------+
```

The `assets` column contains a dictionary mapping band names to URIs holding the
location of each GeoTIFF. To determine what bands are available in the catalog
we can execute the following:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT explode(map_keys(assets)) as asset_keys
FROM modis
ORDER BY asset_keys
-- +-------------+
-- |   asset_keys|
-- +-------------+
-- |          B01|
-- |        B01qa|
-- |          B02|
-- |        B02qa|
-- |          ...|
-- +-------------+
```

The next statement creates a view representing global red and NIR band data
(arbitrarily) on the 15th of each month in 2017. This will give us 12 global
coverages from which we will compute our statistics.

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW red_nir_tiles_monthly_2017 AS
SELECT granule_id, month(acquisition_date) as month, 
       f_read_tiles(assets['B01'], assets['B02']) as (crs, extent, red, nir)
FROM modis
WHERE year(acquisition_date) = 2017 AND day(acquisition_date) = 15;
DESCRIBE red_nir_tiles_monthly_2017;
-- +--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
-- |col_name|data_type                                              |
-- +--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
-- |month   |int                                                    |
-- |crs     |struct<crsProj4:string>                                |
-- |extent  |struct<xmin:double,ymin:double,xmax:double,ymax:double>|
-- |red     |tile                                                   |
-- |nir     |tile                                                   |
-- +--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

Computing the [normalized difference vegetation index][NDVI] (NDVI) is a very
common operation in EO analysis, and is calculated simply as the normalized
difference of the Red and NIR bands from a surface reflectance data product.

<!-- \text{NDVI} = \frac{\text{NIR} - \text{Red}}{\text{NIR} + \text{Red}} -->

<img src="ndvi.png" title="Figure 4: NDVI" width="200px" />

Since a normalized difference is such a common operation in EO analysis,
RasterFrames includes the function `rf_normalizedDifference` to compute it. For
this example we will just collect the aggregate statistics (via `rf_aggStats`)
for NDVI on a per-month basis.

```sql
SELECT month, ndvi_stats.* FROM (
    SELECT month, rf_aggStats(rf_normalizedDifference(nir, red)) as ndvi_stats
    FROM red_nir_tiles_monthly_2017
    GROUP BY month
    ORDER BY month
)
-- +-----+---------+-----------+----+---+-------------------+-------------------+
-- |month|dataCells|noDataCells|min |max|mean               |variance           |

(While the curve is interesting, interpreting it is beyond the scope of this article.)

## Scalability

As stated in the introduction
This same job was run using multiple cluster sizes. Each custer node was an AWS
`m4.large` configuration, which is composed of 4 virtual cores, 8 GB RAM, and 32
GB HDD.

Nodes | Cores | Memory (GB) | Execution Time (min)
----- | ----- | ----------- | --------------------
1     | 4     | 8           | 80
3     | 12    | 24          | 27
5     | 20    | 40          | 18
7     | 28    | 56          | 12
11    | 44    | 88          | 9
15    | 60    | 120         | 8

## Conclusion

As more and more data becomes available in every industry, solutions have emerged to connect the traditional, tabular model of data to computational engines powerful enough to process it at volume. DataFrames and Spark SQL are general purpose tools that provide scalable data analysis through distributed computing. Data science and machine learning are consistently becoming more mainstream, and there is an opportunity for specialized technologies to further abstract common constructs within each problem space. For the EO realm, RasterFrames adds another layer of abstraction that can empower a broader set of users to process EO data in an intuitive way. By combining the technological advancements of its fellow LocationTech projects with DataFrames and Spark SQL, RasterFrames unlocks more natural, scalable machine learning for data analysts and scientists operating under a flood of new data while attempting to address global issues such as deforestation, climate change, and food shortages. As an open-source project and a proud member of Eclipse LocationTech, RasterFrames strives to have a positive global impact.
